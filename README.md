# Progress
* Designed, Developed and Deployed on Kovan TestNet for the Chainlink 2020 Hackathon

# Introduction
* A Conflict Curation Consensus Algorithm Conserved on Chainlink Initiators and Adaptors
* Deployment of a Chainlink Client in the Structure of a Chainlink VRF Powered RANDAO with POA Consensus

# Theory
* Tussle is a consensus algorithm for conflict condensed consensus situations.
* Tussle is currently written based on Proof of Authority Consensus Algorithm
* Tussle is transitining to Proof of Reputation along with Ethereum Roadmap

# Examples
Tussle between Trading Agents
Tussle between Tracking Devices
Tussle between Tyrants in Society

# Lifecycle
* Conflict Condensation phase
* Conflict Resolution phase
* Conflict Annotation phase
* Conflict Conservation phase
* Conflict conjugation phase

## Requirements
* NodeJS
* NPM
* Truffle
* Yarn

## Initialization

* npm install truffle -g
* truffle unbox smartcontractkit/box
* yarn install
* npm test
* yar test

## Installation
* Package installation should have occurred for you during the Truffle Box setup. 
* However, if you add dependencies, you'll need to add them to the project by running:

* npm install Or
* yarn install

## Testing 
* npm test

## Deploy

* If needed, edit the truffle-config.js config file to set the desired network to a different port. 
* It assumes any network is running the RPC port on 8545.

* npm run migrate:dev

* For deploying to live networks, Truffle will use truffle-hdwallet-provider for your mnemonic and an RPC URL. 
* Set your environment variables $RPC_URL and $MNEMONIC before running:

* npm run migrate:live

## Roadmap
* Transition to Proof of Stake
* Transition to Automated Market Makers
* Transition to Proof of Reputation
* Develpment of Oracle Contract Witnesses
